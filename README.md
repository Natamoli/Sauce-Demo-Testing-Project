- **Jira**: To report bugs and track their status.
- **Chrome DevTools**: To check for errors in the browser.
- **GitHub**: To share my testing documentation.

## 📊 How I Managed the Bugs
I used a Jira to manage every bug I found. This helped me keep track of which bugs were new, which were being fixed, and which were finished.

## Example of a Bug Ticket
